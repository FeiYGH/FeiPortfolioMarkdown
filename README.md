## Summary
* I'm a full stack software engineer that loves building and creating! I enjoy Ruby, ReactJS, ReduxJS, Rails, SpringBoot, and AngularJS. I am also good (skillful) at JavaScript, Java, and C++. My most recent project is Shamazin, which is a clone of the Amazon Item Show Page, a full stack group project where we used SpringBoot on the backend and React on the frontend with Postgres as the database. Our team developed it using the agile methodology. Another project I greatly enjoyed was, "Nonprofits Across Different States," a D3 JavaScript interactive graph. StudyPal SF demonstrates another stack that I have worked with; it uses MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, and Node.js to filter through preferences and "roll" a random cafe for those seeking a cafe to study. Please look at my projects section.

I enjoy challenging myself to think methodically and creatively and have found that creativity is not only a part of html/css but also a part of design and structure.

In my free time, I'm a huge foodie, and I love traveling to new places and trying new things. In 2019, I traveled through 13 states in a 10 day time period. My personal favorite was hiking up Angel's Landing in Zion National Park in Utah.
